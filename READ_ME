We decided to creates 4 classes in the tree package:
- Fruit: A class that creates a single fruit and handles its collision with the avatar
- StaticTree: A class that creates the base of a tree and handles the physics and gravity of the
tree
- Flora: A class that handles the creation of the floral part of the game. Flora receives a function
 to get the height of the ground at any given point, and a function that decides what happens with
 the avatar when it collides with a fruits.
 Flora has private functions that creates every element, and a public one that creates everything
 and returns a map of every created object by category.
Flora create multiple instances of Fruit and StaticTree.
- Leaf: The Leaf class creates and manages leaves on trees in the Pepse game.
 It handles their appearance, positioning, and interaction with the avatar.
 Leaves may respond to the avatar's actions and exhibit dynamic behavior.

 We used the observer design pattern, so that the trees, fruits and leaves followed the behavior of
 the avatar and were affected by it according to the requirements of the exercise.
