We decided to creates 3 classes in the tree package:
- Fruit: A class that creates a single fruit and handles its collision with the avatar
- StaticTree: A class that creates the base of a tree and handles the physics and gravity of the
tree
- Flora: A class that handles the creation of the floral part of the game. Flora receives a function
 to get the height of the ground at any given point, and a function that decides what happens with
 the avatar when it collides with a fruits.
 Flora has private functions that creates every element, and a public one that creates everything
 and returns a map of every created object by category.
Flora create multiple instances of Fruit and StaticTree.
